# Run File


This directory contains the run file of FACE, which is used to evaluate the performance against the CRSArena-Eval dataset.


## Run File Format

Single run file for all aspects.
The same format as CRSArena-Eval dataset, but with predicted scores instead of human annotations.
```python
[
  { # Conversation 1
    "conv_id": "string",  # Unique identifier for the conversation
    "turns": [           # List of turns in the conversation
      {
        "turn_ind": float,      # Index of the turn being evaluated (0-based)
        "turn_level_pred": { # Turn-level aspects
          "relevance": float,     # Relevance score (0-3)
          "interestingness": float # Interestingness score (0-2)
        }
      },
      # ... more turns
    ],
    "dial_level_pred": { # Dialogue-level aspects
      "understanding": float, # Understanding score (0-2)
      "task_completion": float, # Task Completion score (0-2)
      "interest_arousal": float, # Interest Arousal score (0-2)
      "efficiency": float,    # Efficiency score (0-2)
      "overall_impression": float # Overall Impression score (0-2)
    }
  # ... more conversations
  }
]
```
